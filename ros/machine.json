This gene is expressed during early embryogenesis and localizes to endo- and mesodermally derived cells during later embryogenesis and thereby plays an important role in gut, lung, and heart development. Mutations in this gene are associated with several congenital defects. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012].",
